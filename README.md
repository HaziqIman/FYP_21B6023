This project enhances network security by integrating an autoencoder-based Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) into a custom Firewall User Interface (UI). An autoencoder model trained on hexadecimal representations of network traffic packets monitors live traffic, distinguishing normal packets from anomalies in real time. Detected anomalies are presented in the UI for further investigation.
